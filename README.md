### A simple calculator !

Like the title says, it's a simple calculator WebApp. I created it to train my JS logic.

### ‚úÖ What Could Be Improved (Post-Project To-Do)

- Text overflow system. I don't have the knowledge rn but i WILL learn it :))
- My CSS logic. I should've planned in advance a more versatile naming convention, as well as some simpler stuff. Next time, i'll divide it using comments, and better names :)
- Animations and color palette, even if it's pretty acceptable.
- Everything basically, even tho i don't think i created a technical debt on the js handler, but the css is TERRIBLE :(

### üß© Additional Ideas (Optional)

- Fun animations for the whole calculator when you spam the divide by zero.
- Sounds (for the lol)
- A scientific mode + skins.

### üß© Retrospection

It looked pretty simple but i had to take some pause to figure the js logic lol. I also chose to not use a css framework, even if it would've looked way better. I feel like it's kind of cheating tbh ahah.
Anyway, pretty hard, but i learned a lot of new integrated functions, so i guess it's a win + it works :))))
